# Competitive Programming C++ Template

Debugging tasks already setup for Mac (Clang)

### Steps:

- Install C++ extension on mac and ensure Clang is installed
    - Steps here (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-clang-mac). 
    - No need to do the rest of steps. Just the extension and clang.
- Clone the repo
- Open `basic.cpp`. Open the Run & Debug section on VS Code
- You should see the `C/C++: clang++ build and debug active file` task.
- Manually open mac system terminal (IMPORTANT). Terminal does not open automatically. [Known issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cpptools/issues/5079).
- Create a breakpoint anywhere in the code. 
- Click to run and debug!
